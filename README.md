# 🧠 Brain MRI Tumor Classification

This project focuses on classifying **Brain MRI images** into four categories using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:

- Glioma  
- Meningioma  
- Pituitary  
- No Tumor  

The model is trained and evaluated on a curated MRI dataset, with separate training and testing folders for each class.  
This work was done as part of the **EEE-GS-513 Machine Learning Course Project**.
