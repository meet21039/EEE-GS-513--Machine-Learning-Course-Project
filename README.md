# 🧠 Brain MRI Tumor Classification

This project focuses on classifying **Brain MRI images** into four categories using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:

- Glioma  
- Meningioma  
- Pituitary  
- No Tumor  

The model is trained and evaluated on a curated MRI dataset, with separate training and testing folders for each class.  
This work was done as part of the **EEE-GS-513 Machine Learning Course Project**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

### 🎯 Objective
To automatically classify MRI brain scans into four categories using deep learning techniques, improving accuracy and efficiency in tumor detection.

### 💡 Methodology
1. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Organized MRI scans into folders: `glioma/`, `meningioma/`, `pituitary/`, `no_tumor/`.
   - Split into training and testing sets.
   - Applied normalization and data augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom).

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Baseline CNN with multiple convolutional + pooling layers.
   - Trained using **Adam optimizer** and **categorical cross-entropy loss**.
   - Metrics: Accuracy, AUC (Area Under Curve).

3. **Training & Evaluation**
   - Trained on Google Colab using GPU runtime.
   - Early stopping and checkpointing used for best model retention.
   - Evaluated using confusion matrix, ROC AUC, and classification report.
